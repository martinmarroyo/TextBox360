The Ultimate Text Adventure Machine - Version 1.0
```

A light-weight Linux distribution with Python installed. The main purpose for this at the moment is to be a place to run text adventure games created with Python. TextBox360 runs in a Docker container and takes up very little space. You can use the launcher script to start it up based on your operating system (see `windows/launch.bat` for Windows users and `unix/launch.sh` for Mac/Linux users.)

- Docker Desktop: [Download it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
